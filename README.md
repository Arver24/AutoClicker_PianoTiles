# <p style="text-align: center;"> INSTRUCTIONS

Do follow these to a t.
Non-compliance can lead to:

- the creation of Skynet
- is anything else scarier?

so <b>THE INSTRUCTIONS</b> :

1. Open this [link](https://www.agame.com/game/magic-piano-tiles)
2. Download and open the .py file in this repo
3. Install requirements by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` preferably in a virtual environment
4. Go to the link tab and press the full screen button.....hopefully everyone knows how that looks like
5. Go back to the .py file and run it....MAKE SURE NOTHING BLACK IS ON YOUR SCREEN
6. Go to the link tab
7. Press start, leave the mouse, grab a cup of coffee or tea
8. Wear Headphones
9. ENJOY

#### P.S.: Works best with 60Hz refresh rate. Higher than that, it gets too fast for the system to handle after about 170-180 points. (Working on that)
